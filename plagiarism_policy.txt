The official McGill plagiarism policy is at:
https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/academicrights/integrity/cheating

I have no problem with students talking together.  However, you must
do your own work/type in your own codes without looking at other's
work.  If two codes come in looking identical, I will consider that a
violation.
